    <h1>My Student Bio</h1>

    <h2>Meier Cohen, 27, Florida</h2>
    <p>I am a 27-year-old father raised in St. Pete, Florida. My son is 4 years old. Family is my heart and my motivation. My lifestyle includes exercise, healthy eating, pranayama, sunlight, and the discipline of kindness. I love to learn new things, whether through studied knowledge or experienced wisdom. I have thrived through adversity and chaos growing up, and in my late 20s, I achieved structure by changing my approach to biohacking, essentially clearing my mind and body and programming new habits.

    I have started a dozen small businesses and worked as a restaurant cook, carpenter, landscaper, driver, travel agent, and market vendor. I have skills in networking, communication, problem-solving, and creativity. I am ambitious, passionate, determined, self-controlled, empathetic, and self-aware. I do not get stressed easily and always have high energy. I know how to bring my body and mind to a state of balance. I love working with others or working alone.
    
    I would like to start my career in tech. I enjoy the work, learning new things constantly, and contributing to the community and future clients. I love solving problems for others and being of service.</p>
